# Advanced JavaScript Concepts with [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io)

## [🔗 Prototype Chain](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-prototype-chain/)

Except for primitives, everything in JavaScript is an Object.

- Inheritance between JavaScript Objects

- { }

- `new Object()`

- `.__proto__`

- `Object.setPrototypeOf()`

- `Object.getPrototypeOf()`

## [🍳 Object destructuring](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-destructuring/)

- DRY code

- Destructuring assignment

## [👫 ...Spread Operator](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-spread/)

- `...`

- `const life = [...idk, ...fucked]`

`Note:` where you import objects matter, it will overwrite the previous values!

## [⛓ Optional Chaining](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-optional-chaining/)

Basically, **error handling* while calling/assigning an object's property that may or may not exist yet...

- `const starboy = homoSapien?.name;`

## [🦺 Nullish Coalescing (`??`)](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-nullish-coalescing/)

- JS is a weakly typed language, so `types` behave a little different than in other languages...

- **Type Coercion**

`Note:` While using `??`, only `null` and `undefined` are considered as **falsy**!
