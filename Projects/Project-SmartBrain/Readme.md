# The Journey...

Life's one funny mf... I really thought that it was goin' to be easy but what can i say... if it was easy then everyone would do it, innit?

- The whole project `Frontend & Backend` took about 2 months.
- The `gRPC` integration took about 3 days alone n' 1 mental breakdown!

Let's just keep going... im doin' it for the very first time so, maybe i shouldn't expect too much... No Expectations!

## Until next time...
