# [100sec Of React](https://fireship.io/courses/react/)
Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)!

### As you have seen in this 100sec of React, as you add more n more components, the `App.jsx` gets so fuckin hard to manage. 

- Keep all the components in their own separate files, even in their own separate folders.

### Maintain code readability. Just as life, try to give your code some meaning. At least give 'em a meaningful name ...lol ;)

- Remember when you tried to read it after just 2 days? ...lol ;)
