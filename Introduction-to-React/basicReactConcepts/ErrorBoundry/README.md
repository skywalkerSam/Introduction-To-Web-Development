# Error Boundry




# NOTES:
- Keep it **Simple**, don't over-engineer things unnecessarily!
- Uni-directional data flow, **Parent to child** only, not vice-versa!
- Everytime the state changes, the component **re-renders**.
- **Prop drilling** isn't good in long-term but if you have to, `useContext()`
- Keep it minimal, too much data can lead to **performance issues**!
  

`NOTE`: **Expressions** and **Statements** are two different things, you can only use expressions inside JSX (**JavaScript Expression**)
