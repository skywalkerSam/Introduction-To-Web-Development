# ğŸ”€ Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering is a very common pattern where you render a component based on a boolean condition. There are several ways to implement conditional rendering in React.

## 1. If Else
```javascript
function Conditional({ count }) {

  if (count > 5) {
    return <h1>Count is greater than 5</h1>;
  } else {
    return <h1>Count is less than 5</h1>;
  }
}
```

## 2. Ternary `? :`
```javascript
{count % 2 === 0 ? <h1>Count is even</h1> : <h1>Count is odd</h1> }
```

## 3. Logical And `&&`
```javascript
{count && 2 === 0 ? <h1>Count is even</h1> }
```
